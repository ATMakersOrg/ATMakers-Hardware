This is a PTH-only design that should be simple to assemble.  It has a FeatherWing format and should allow a microcontroller to interface with a PG-Drives powerchair controller.

The design was based off of the details in section 6 of this manual: http://sunrise.pgdrivestechnology.com/manuals/pgdt_omni_manual_SK78813-07.pdf

It is based on the Adafruit DS3502 Digital Pot breakout
